  summary: Filesystem-like pathing and searching for dictionaries
  description: |
    A python library for accessing and searching dictionaries via /slashed/paths
    ala xpath. Basically it lets you glob over a dictionary as if it were a filesystem.
    It allows you to specify globs (ala the bash eglob syntax, through some advanced
    fnmatch.fnmatch magic) to access dictionary elements, and provides some
    facility for filtering those results.
